##notes on mongodb programming
# adding this readme file.

# to install mongodb go to https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community?tck=docs_server
# download the server version (in my case ubuntu 16.04 LTS, used software installer to install
# update: 2/2/2021 - downloaded windows msi file from community site and installed.
## on windows , you can start mongodb as services or web application. service is much easier as
##   app server requires new account (mongodb) and file ownerships
# start the server using these commands:
### sudo systemctl start mongod
##  systemctl status mongod
##  to restart use 'restart'
##   to stop/shutdown use 'stop'

## you may need to install mongo-client to be able to invoke a mongo shell
### this is done using the same URL used to install mongodb server. choose ubuntu 16.04 and mongo shell to download
## installed deb and used software install instead of 'save file' to install to ubuntu 16.04
mongo --host <host> --port <port_number>

An example is provided below
mongo --host 192.168.0.104 --port 28019

Now we shall run a simple query db to know the database the shell is pointing to.
> db
test

test is a default database.
